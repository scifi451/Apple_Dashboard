          <h4>Services</h4> <br>
          
          <p>The services category includes revenue from the App store (one-time sales and app subscriptions), iTunes product sales (music, tv shows, and movies), iCloud (extra storage), Apple Pay, Apple Card, and AppleCare and Apple Music.</p>
          <p>Apple has had a strong focus on dramatically increases their services revenue over the last six years. This growth has been done by continually increasing the number of services they offer over this time period. With Apple Pay launching in 2014, Apple Music subscription service in June 2015, Apple Card in August 2019, and Apple TV+ in November 2019. </p>
          <p>Since Q3 of 2015 the services category has always had double digit year over year growth and seeing growth as high as 39.97% in Q2 of 2018 in that span. Another important thing to note is that the services revenue is much consistent since it is ongoing revenue as compared to the hardware categories which are much more seasonal in their fluctuations in terms of sale numbers.</p>
