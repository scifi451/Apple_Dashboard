            Mac
            The Mac lineup was long the mainstay of Apple and what was the main driver of the company until the introduction of the iPhone and iPod lineups, with the iPhone that has helped drive the company since then. The iPod had two quarters where it was finished ahead of the Mac in the fiscal quarter one of 2006 and 2007, which was driven by holiday sales given that quarter covers the Christmas/thanksgiving period. The last time the Mac category was the largest share of the quarterly revenue was in fiscal quarter three in 2009 when the Mac had 3.35 billion and the iPhone had 3.06 billion and since then the iPhone has been on top of the quarterly numbers. Even though the Mac is no longer the driver of the company it is still is a valuable part of it given that alone it ranks 118th on the Fortune 500 rank for 2019.
