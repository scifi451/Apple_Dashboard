            <h1>Graphs of Apple Financial Numbers</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This website was created to present the project work I completed to look at the financial numbers Apple has been able to post over the last number of years.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Body of the page -->
    <p>It presents the quarterly and yearly financial numbers for five Apple product categories of Mac, iPhone, iPad, the broader category of wearables which also include home and accessories and finally services. This site is more of a broader overview of Apple’s product categories instead of a real deep dive into the company.</p>

    <p>A financial note is that Apple fiscal year runs from September to September. For example, for 2019 to 2020 Apple's fiscal year is September 29, 2019, through September 26, 2020. The other point to note is that the traditionally big holiday quarter is now reflected in Apple’s fiscal quarter one.</p>
        
    <p>To understand how much the iPhone, Wearables, iPad, Mac, and Services categories actually make it is to compare them to other stand-alone companies as if they were their own individual companies so you can get a better scale of the success of each of them. This is why I have compared them to other Fortune 500 companies to see where these different Apple product categories would rate.</p>

    <p>Each page has three visual parts to it: A quarterly revenue graph for the product segment, a yearly revenue segment, and a table with a comparison of where it would rank in the Fortune 500 if it was its own separate company.</p>

    <p>The Fortune 500 Numbers are from the year 2018 which Fortune calls the 2019 rankings. The Apple numbers I pulled from the financial 2019 year since I had that readily accessible given my research. With the exception of the combined numbers that is the 2018 Apple yearly revenue number there instead of the 2019 numbers, I have used elsewhere.</p>
