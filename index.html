            <h1>Graphs of Apple Quarterly Financial Numbers</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This website was created to present the side project work I completed to look at the financial numbers Apple has been able to post over the last number of years.
              </p>
          </div>

        This website presents the quarterly financial numbers for five Apple product categoires of Mac, iPhone, iPad, the broader category of wearables, home, and accessories and finally  services. This is site is  more of a broader overview of Apples product categoires instead of a real deep dive into the company.</p>
      
        <p>A financial note is that Apple fiscal year runs from September to September. For example for 2019 to 2020 Apple's fiscal year is September 29, 2019, through September 26, 2020. The other point to note for that is that the traditionally big holiday quarter is now reflected in Appleâ€™s fiscal quarter one.</p>
       
        <p>Each page has three visual parts to it: A quarterly revenue graph for the product segment, a yearly revenue segment, and table with a comparision of where it would rank in the Fortune 500 if it was its own seperate company. All Fortune 500 Numbers are from the 2018 year expect for the Apple numbers which I pulled from the finanical 2019 year since had that readilly accessible. With the exception of the combined numbers that is the 2018 Apple yearly revenue number there.</p>
