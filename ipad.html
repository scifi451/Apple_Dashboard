          <h4> iPad</h4> <br>
          <p>The iPad is a story of one that has had skyrocketing growth and then hit its peak and has declined a bit but has steadied out and started to rebound. By its third year (2012) it had almost 31 billion dollars in yearly revenue and then in its fourth year almost had 32 billion which is its peak for yearly revenue. This is in comparison to the iPhone which did not hit over 32 billion in yearly revenue until year five (2011) when it earned just under 46 billion.</p>
          <p>While the iPad has not hit the continue growth that the iPhone had it still shot up quickly given it created a brand new category that largely did not have successful entrant into the field before it came out. In regards to the decline in yearly revenue for the iPad, it has tended to have a much longer upgrade cycle as compared to the iPhone which has so far tended to be at a shorter upgrade cycle. The introduction of the new iPad Pro models with its new screen sizes has helped to bring new growth to the iPad lineup. For 2019 it was able to break a five-year yearly revenue decline and produce a 14% year over year gain in revenue from 2018 to 2019.</p>
